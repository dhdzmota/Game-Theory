    "**Rules**. The ante, the deal, and the options for $P_1$ are just as in Game 1, and if $P_1$ elects to raise, $P_2$'s options are also as in Game 1. However, if $P_1$ elects to pass, the play is not terminated, but $P_2$ can either pass or raise. If $P_2$ elects to pass, play is terminated and the pot distributed as before. If $P_2$ elects to raise, both he and $P_1$ add an amount $b$ to the pot, and men the pot is distributed as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the only difference betwen this game and Game 1 is that if $P_1$ chooses to pass, $P_2$ now has the oportunity to increase the pot to $a+b$, and $P_1$ cannot withdraw if $P_2$ wishes to increase the pot. $P_1$'s strategy set remains the same, but now a strategy for $P_2$ must direct her response to both possible plays of $P_1$. Thus a possible strategy for $P_2$ would be to fold if $P_1$ raises and raise if $P_1$ passes. This strategy is denoted by $(F,R)$, where the first component of the ordered pair is $P_2$'s response to a raise by $P_1$ and the second component is her response to pass, with the obvious abbreviations for fold, call, pass, raise. $P_2$ has four pure strategies, denoted by: $(C,R)$,$(C,P)$,$(F,R)$ and $(F,P)$.\n",
