    "**Rules**. *Players 1 and 2 ante an amount $a > 0$ into the pot. One card is dealt to $P_1$ from a deck containing an equal number of high and low cards. After looking at his card, $P_1$ can either \"pass\" or \"raise.\" If $P_1$ passes, $P_1$ wins the pot if he had been dealt a high card and loses the pot if he had been dealt a low card. If $P_1$ raises, he adds an\n",
    "amount $b > 0$ to the pot, and then $P_2$ has two options. $P_2$ can either \"fold\" or \"call.\" If $P_2$ folds, $P_1$ wins the pot (without revealing his hand). If $P_2$ calls, he also adds the amount $b$ to the pot, and then $P_1$ wins or loses the pot if he has been dealt a high or low card, respectively.*   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if $P_1$ is dealt a high card, he is guaranteed to win at least the amount $a$ from $P_2$, and he can win $a + b$ if he raises and $P_1$ elects to call. On the other hand, if $P_1$ is dealt a low card, he can pass and lose the amount $a$ or he can raise (i.e., bluff), with the hope that $P_2$ will assume that $P_1$ has a high card and elect to fold. If $P_2$ folds, $P_1$ wins a even though he has a low card. However, if $P_2$ suspects that $P_1$ does not have a high card but is bluffing, $P_2$ can call, and now $P_1$ loses not $a$ but $a + b$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To apply our theory to this game, we must first list all the possible strategies for the two players. Recall that a strategy is a rule that tells a player what to do in any possible situation the player may encounter during the game. Consider $P_1$'s situation. He is dealt either a high or low card, and so a strategy for him must tell him what to do in either case. Thus a possible strategy for $P_1$ would be to raise if he has a high card and pass if he has a low card. We will denote this strategy by $(R,P)$, where the first component of the ordered pair directs $P_1$ if he has a high card and the second component if he has a low card, with $R$ corresponding to *raising* and $P$ to *passing*. It can be seen that $P_1$ has four possible strategies, denoted by $(R,R)$, $(R,P)$, $(P,R)$, and $(P,P)$. Thus $(P,P)$ directs $P_1$ to pass no matter what he has been dealt, and $(P,R)$ directs him to pass on a high card and raise on a low card. The strategy set for $P_2$ is simpler because she is unaware of the card dealt $P_1$. If $P_1$ elects to pass, $P_2$ has no options and the game is terminated. If $P_1$ elects to raise, $P_2$ can either call or fold, and so a strategy for $P_2$ is a rule that directs $P_2$'s response to a raise by $P_1$. Denote these two possible strategies by *call* and *fold*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the payoff matrix associated with this game is 4 x 2. Since the outcome of the game is contingent not only on the strategies employed by the players but also on the card dealt $P_1$, the entries of the matrix are found by computing the expected value of the outcome to $P_1$ for the eight possible strategy pairs. For example, suppose $P_1$ uses strategy $(P,R)$ and $P_2$ uses strategy call. Then if $P_1$ is dealt a high card, he passes and wins a, and if he is dealt a low card, he raises and $P_2$ calls, and so $P_1$ loses $a + b$. Since we are assuming that the deck contains an equal number of high and low cards and that the card dealt $P_1$ is randomly chosen, the probabilities of both a high-card hand and a low-card hand are \\. Thus the expected value of the outcome corresponding to this strategy pair is $\\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{(-a - b)}{2} = -\\frac{b}{2}$. Similarly, if $P_1$ uses strategy $(R, P)$ and $P_2$ uses strategy fold, on a high-card deal, $P_1$ raises, $P_2$ folds, and $P_1$ wins $a$, and on a low-card deal, $P_1$ passes and loses $a$. The expected outcome is therefore $\\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{-a}{2} = 0$.\n",
